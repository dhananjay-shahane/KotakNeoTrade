# Kotak Neo Trading Application

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Flask-based web application that integrates with the Kotak Neo trading API to provide a full-featured trading platform. The application enables users to manage their trading portfolios, place orders, track positions and holdings, and monitor real-time market data through a modern Bootstrap-powered web interface.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern Flask architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Backend**: Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy ORM for database management
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS for responsive UI/UX
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistent data storage
- **API Integration**: Kotak Neo API Python SDK for trading functionality
- **Session Management**: Flask-Session with filesystem storage for user sessions
- **Real-time Updates**: JavaScript-based dashboard with auto-refresh capabilities

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **TOTP-based Authentication**: Users authenticate using mobile number, UCC, TOTP code, and MPIN
- **Token Management**: Secure storage and management of access tokens and session tokens
- **Session Persistence**: 24-hour session duration with automatic renewal
- **Security**: Protected routes using decorators and session validation

### Trading Engine
- **Order Management**: Place, modify, and cancel orders across different exchanges
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Real-time positions and holdings monitoring
- **Market Data**: Live quotes and price updates
- **Risk Management**: Built-in validation and error handling

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials, account information, and session tokens
- **User Sessions**: Tracks active sessions with expiration management
- **User Preferences**: Customizable trading preferences and settings

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Bootstrap 5 interface
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Auto-refreshing portfolio overview
- **Interactive Charts**: Market data visualization
- **Trading Forms**: Intuitive order placement and management

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User submits TOTP credentials
   - System validates with Kotak Neo API
   - Session tokens stored in database and Flask session
   - User redirected to dashboard

2. **Trading Operations**:
   - All trading requests routed through Flask API endpoints
   - Session validation on each request
   - Kotak Neo API integration for actual trade execution
   - Real-time updates pushed to frontend

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - User data stored in PostgreSQL
   - Session management through Flask-Session
   - Trading history and preferences maintained
