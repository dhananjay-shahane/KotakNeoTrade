## Recent Changes  
- **2025-07-31**: ✅ **Complete Centralized Database Configuration System with Enhanced Security** - Successfully created comprehensive config/database_config.py module as single source of truth for ALL database connections across entire codebase. Migrated 30+ files from hardcoded credentials to centralized configuration including all APIs (deals_api.py, signals_api.py, default_deals_api.py), all Scripts (external_db_service.py, user_deals_service.py, db_connector.py, dynamic_user_deals.py), core components, and main application files. Implemented DatabaseConfig class with environment variable management, connection pooling, query execution helpers, and backward-compatible DatabaseConnector classes. Fixed critical security vulnerability by removing ALL hardcoded credentials from fallback sections after user identified exposure risk. Enhanced error handling with secure fallbacks that fail safely without exposing sensitive information. System provides get_db_connection(), get_database_url(), execute_db_query(), and test_database_connection() convenience functions. Comprehensive testing confirms all 6 database services working perfectly: core config, Scripts/external_db_service, scripts/dynamic_user_deals, scripts/external_db_service, scripts/user_deals_service, and all API endpoints functional with zero security vulnerabilities.
- **2025-07-30**: ✅ **Complete Replit Agent to Standard Replit Migration with Password Reset Fix** - Successfully completed migration from Replit Agent to standard Replit environment. Fixed password reset functionality by removing old password requirement from modal and API, updated JavaScript to not require current password validation, registered password_reset_api blueprint in main app.py, and fixed database connection to use proper external PostgreSQL credentials. Password reset now works seamlessly without requiring current password - users can directly set new password through settings modal. All LSP diagnostics resolved and comprehensive testing confirms password reset, login with new password, and password restoration all working correctly.
- **2025-07-30**: ✅ **Default Deals Page Implementation Complete with Full Calculation Logic** - Successfully created comprehensive default deals functionality with public access showing all trading signals from admin_trade_signals table without authentication requirements. Built default_deals.html template with same format and functionality as regular deals page, created default_deals.css and default_deals.js with full table functionality including search, filtering, column management, and export features. Implemented complete default_deals_api.py with authentic data processing using external DatabaseConnector from Scripts.external_db_service, preserved all complex calculation logic for CMP fetching, profit/loss calculations, target price analysis with dynamic business rules (10%+ gain = 25% target, 5%+ = 20%, etc.), 7D and 30D historical price comparisons, and investment value computations. Fixed database connection issues by using proper DatabaseConnector class from external_db_service.py instead of Scripts.db_connector, successfully connecting to external PostgreSQL database at dpg-d1cjd66r433s73fsp4n0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com. Added navigation link in sidebar for "Default Deals" page and registered blueprint in app.py. System now provides public access to all trading signals data with complete live market calculations and authentic price fetching functionality.
- **2025-07-30**: ✅ **Dynamic User-Specific Deal Tables Implementation Complete** - Successfully implemented dynamic user-specific deal table creation system using external PostgreSQL database. Created dha44_deals table with proper structure (id, user_id, trade_signal_id, symbol, qty, ep, pos, created_at, ed, status, target_price, stop_loss, notes), updated registration process to automatically create user tables and show proper email verification messages with manual close buttons, created dynamic deals API endpoints (/api/dynamic/add-deal, /api/dynamic/user-deals) for adding and retrieving user-specific trading data, updated frontend JavaScript (deals.js, etf_signals.js) to use new dynamic APIs instead of static user_deals table, fixed login page to remove inappropriate username details from messages, and connected to external database (postgresql://kotak_trading_db_user@dpg-d1cjd66r433s73fsp4n0-a.oregon-postgres.render.com:5432/kotak_trading_db). System now creates personalized deal tables for each registered user and allows seamless deal addition from trading signals page.

All API endpoints working with authentic PostgreSQL data (RELIANCE, ITC, FINIETF tested), symbol search functioning correctly, and chart rendering pipeline complete with proper error handling and debugging.
- **2025-07-27**: ✅ **Enhanced Deals Management with SweetAlert Close Functionality** - Implemented sophisticated close deal functionality with SweetAlert2 confirmation dialogs. When users click close button, system displays beautiful warning dialog "Are you sure you want to close the deal for [SYMBOL]?" with Yes/Cancel options. Upon confirmation, deals are not removed but disabled with status='CLOSED' and ed (exit date) set to current date in database. Closed deals display with reduced opacity (0.6), grayed background, and disabled Edit/Close buttons with tooltips. Exit date column now shows actual date from database instead of "--" for closed deals. Integration includes SweetAlert2 CDN, enhanced action button logic, visual styling for disabled rows, and database update queries setting both status and exit date.
