# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
The deployment was failing due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues with setuptools and pip dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Python Version
- Changed from `python-3.13` to `python-3.11.8` in `runtime.txt`
- Python 3.11.8 has better compatibility with current package ecosystem

### 2. Requirements Update
- Added explicit setuptools, wheel, and pip versions at the top of `render_requirements.txt`
- These base packages need to be installed first to avoid import errors

### 3. Build Command Optimization
- Updated build command to install setuptools and wheel first
- Added `--no-cache-dir` flag to avoid caching issues
- This ensures clean package installation

### 4. Main Application Fixes
- Simplified `main_render.py` to avoid circular imports
- Moved database initialization to be safer for production
- Added proper error handling for database setup

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push these changes to your repository**
2. **Redeploy on Render** - the build should now succeed
3. **Environment Variables Required:**
   - `DATABASE_URL` (automatically set by Render PostgreSQL)
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (automatically generated by Render)

## Expected Result
- Clean build without setuptools errors
- Application starts on port assigned by Render
- Database connection established
- Health check endpoints working at `/health` and `/render-health`

## Cost: $14/month for Starter plan with PostgreSQL database
